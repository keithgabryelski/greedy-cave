  3542: "I was never poor, that’s certain, but I never imagined I wouldn’t have to work a day in my life again. I haven’t dipped into my bank to pay a bill in months, and this estate isn’t cheap on the upkeep.",
  3543: "Page 5",
  3544: "More and more people are starting to show up looking for access to the mines. I’m making money hand over fist with this thing… But what if I could make more?",
  3545: "Page 6",
  3546: "I was wondering the other day… Why suddenly all the interest in this random set of mines under my house, that no one even knew existed? Not a mention in a lifetime, and now in a matter of weeks, dozens of visitors have come through. What triggered this? I should find out one of these days.",
  3547: "Page 7",
  3548: "Yet more people show up by the day. I can’t even keep count anymore. Not that I’m complaining. Some folk are even setting up shop nearby. Looks like travelling caravans mostly, but still!",
  3549: "Page 8",
  3550: "This place is starting to attract a really wide variety of people. A respectable young intellectual looking type wanted to explore the mines. He didn’t look the type, but I sold him a license all the same. He said his name was Heimfeld. Nice fella’.",
  3551: "Page 9",
  3552: "Winter is almost here. I wonder if the influx of travellers will continue throughout these arduous months. The lands seem to turn sombre and enigmatic this time of year…",
  3553: "Page 10",
  3554: "First snow hit today. It’s not much, but it never really amounts to anything. Most notably we get awful howling winds that pierce you right down to the core.",
  3555: "Page 11",
  3556: "It turns out Heimfeld is a professor of some sort, from a university in some foreign country -- says he is writing a thesis on geological anomalies, and that the mines beneath the surface here go deeper than anywhere he’s ever seen before.",
  3557: "Page 12",
  3558: "There are still people arriving every day. It’s becoming a lot to deal with. Maybe I should hire someone to take care of the clerical side of things, so I can focus on counting all the profit I’m making!",
  3559: "Page 13",
  3560: "It’s still hard to believe this all just started happening out of the blue about a year ago. I can hardly remember a time before this place was abustlin’ with people.",
  3561: "Page 14",
  3562: "There's talk of extravagant treasures being found in the mines by some of the more skilled adventurers. Still… It can't compare to getting paid to do nothing, like me!",
  3563: "Page 15",
  3564: "This place is making everyone filthy rich! Perhaps this might lead to a burst of new life for this old place. Not in over 100 years has this place prospered so.",
  3565: "Page 16",
  3566: "I’ve developed quite the rapport with young Dr. Heimfeld. There’s no limit to the curiosities of that man, and at less than half my age, I’m sure he’s got a long path before him in life. He’s going to go far, maybe even change the world one day, the way he talks.",
  3567: "Page 17",
  3568: "Dr. Heimfeld paid me a visit today. He had all kinds of questions about the estate, and how long it had been with my family. Seems he plans to stay a while.",
  3569: "Page 18",
  3570: "His questions got me to thinking, how long HAD this estate been with my family. The manor itself is a relic of the Victorian era, but my own lineage can be traced to a completely different area. So when did we come here?",
  3571: "Page 19",
  3572: "I wonder why Heimfeld wanted to know those things. I don't see how it could possibly relate to anything relevant about his research…",
  3573: "Page 20",
  3574: "After extensive research in the manor's library, I've found no signs that our family ever resided here until before my great grandfather. So why did we move here?",
  3575: "Page 21",
  3576: "Dr. Heimfeld asked, in passing, if he could bring some hardware down to the mines. “For studyin’ the earth”, he said. For some reason, it came to me to demand a much higher price on his weekly fees in return. I didn’t need it, but some kind of primal greed took over me. Luckily, he agreed without hesitation. He must be really dedicated to his work.",
  3577: "I think I might take the time to read the book Heimfeld is writing. He's been working here so long, it must be really interesting.",
  3578: "Page 23",
  3579: "Last time I saw him, Heimfeld gave me a gift. A sort of statuette - He said it brings forth new things into this world, and symbolizes rebirth of the old. I guess he meant it as a suggestion that I should do something worthwhile in my old age, now that I have so much money.",
  3580: "Page 24",
  3581: "The figurine he gave me is of a man, cloaked and hooded, but of strong stature. I wonder who it represents.",
  3582: "Page 25",
  3583: "I hadn't given it much thought, but seeing that statuette on my mantle every day… It's started to creep me out. Almost like it watches me as I pass.",
  3584: "Page 26",
  3585: "I could have sworn the statuette was of a man. Yet what I saw today was no representation of man, but of ungodly beast! I couldn't describe the shape, it was like nothing I'd ever seen before…",
  3586: "Page 27",
  3587: "I didn't even go downstairs today, for fear of looking at that damned statuette. I must be getting paranoid, but I dare not verify.",
  3588: "Page 28",
  3589: "I stumbled in the dark with a blanket, in an attempt to cover the figurine, hide it from sight. In my stupor, I fumbled the statuette, causing it to fall and shatter into a thousand pieces… At least it's gone now. I Hope Heimfeld will forgive me.",
  3590: "Page 29",
  3591: "I haven’t seen Dr. Heimfeld in weeks. He must be enthralled with his research. I hadn’t realized, but I don’t think I’ve had a real conversation with anyone other than him in months… Perhaps I’ll have a stroll outside.",
  3592: "Page 30",
  3593: "The town is almost completely deserted. The caravans are still there, but they refused to speak to me. They just said they didn't want to be bothered. That their fee had been paid and to leave them alone.",
  3594: "Page 31",
  3595: "I can't remember the last time I spoke to Heimfeld. I went to the mines, but the workers there barred me from entering. Said the professor was mighty busy.",
  3596: "Page 32",
  3597: "There was a strange look in their eyes… Almost like fear, but determined to the bone all the same. It was unnerving.",
  3598: "Page 33",
  3599: "Everyone is shunning me. I haven't had a conversation with a real person in what feels like a month, I've lost count. ",
  3600: "Page 34",
  3601: "I don't understand what is going on, but it seems I'm on my own dealing with this madness.",
  3602: "Page 35",
  3603: "The sheriff came around the other day asking for a missing person last seen in the company of Dr. Heimfeld.",
  3604: "Page 36",
  3605: "So many people come through here wanting to explore the mines, how can I be expected to remember them all. I told him he was welcome to go check himself. He didn’t seem too keen.",
  3606: "Page 37",
  3607: "A corpse turned up in the forest near the mines. Could it be the missing person the Sheriff was asking about a few days ago?",
  3608: "Page 38",
  3609: "Lawmen are all over the place, swarming the grounds like ants. I guess the missing person was important somehow? More likely, just another poor soul.",
  3610: "Page 39",
  3611: "They've mounted a full investigation. I told them about the mines, but I didn't tell them anything about Dr. Heimfeld…",
  3612: "Page 40",
  3613: "Perhaps I should have, but he's always paid his outrageous fees on time or in advance. I owe it to him to keep his research quiet…",
  3614: "Page 41",
  3615: "They said the body had been dead for at least three weeks, but I thought I saw that man just a few days before the Sheriff questioned me about it…",
  3616: "Page 42",
  3617: "I'm trying not to think about it. I can't comprehend… ",
  3618: "Page 43",
  3619: "It doesn't add up, none of this makes any sense. Am I going mad?",
  3620: "Page 44",
  3621: "I can't sleep. What could have done that to a corpse in a matter of days? It looked like it had the life drained right out of it.",
  3622: "Page 45",
  3623: "There’s definitely something strange going on here… something… ",
  3624: "Page 46",
  3625: "I been trying not to think about it, but it’s deeply unsettling. What’s going on down there?",
  3626: "Page 47",
  3627: "Haven't seen a single lawman in days. Did they give up? Perhaps they were paid off? They left without a word, suddenly gone.",
  3628: "Page 48",
  3629: "More corpses are turning up. No one is reporting these people missing, and no one seems to be looking for them. Just what is going on around here?",
  3630: "Page 49",
  3631: "From my estate, perched at my window I can see the comings and goings of the mine. They haul out a dozen bags every day, but no bags ever seem to be going in…",
  3632: "Page 50",
  3633: "The bags… They must be hiding something, but what? Are they hauling out the earth itself or is it something else?",
  3634: "Page 51",
  3635: "He’s done it. Dr. Heimfeld must have achieved what he came for. There was an explosion and what felt like an earthquake, followed by a putrid… unimaginable stench filling the air.",
  3636: "Page 52",
  3637: "The smell just won't go away. It's like sulphur burning, a thick and vile aroma that fills your nostrils and mind until it is the only thing you can focus on. It's nauseating, maddening…",
  3638: "Page 53",
  3639: "Yet the smell persists. Is this the end of times? Vegetation around the mouth of the caves is rotting, and it seems all the birds have left the forest. I'd wager they'd rather be anywhere but here… as would I.",
  3640: "Page 54",
  3641: "I had to go see for myself. I wish I hadn’t. Untold horrors, incomprehensible vileness, and an unmistakable aura of pure evil now resides in these depths. Perhaps everything went wrong for Dr. Heimfeld… Or is this what he wanted?\nI’ve made a terrible mistake… but it’s not my fault… how was I to know what was down there? And even if I had known, I would never have thought someone crazy enough to wake it purposefully.",
  3642: "Page 55",
  3643: "I’ve got to get out. I can’t last another minute in this place. At dawn I’ll pack my things and be on the first wagon headed westward. I just have a few things to take care of first…　\nI can’t leave… I try, but I cannot. No… that’s not right. I can leave. But I always wake up back here. It seems I am somehow bound to this place. Could it be the reason Heimfeld insisted I maintain ownership of the mines? Has he tricked me into trapping myself here with this indomitable evil?",
  3644: "Page 56",
  3645: "I must rid myself of what binds me to this place. I renounce my ownership! I've drafted a letter and sent it to my distant nephew, claiming he is to inherit these accursed lands from me. Perhaps then, I will finally be able to leave this nightmare.",
